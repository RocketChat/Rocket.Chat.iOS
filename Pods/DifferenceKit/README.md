## Features

üí° Fastest **O(n)** diffing algorithm optimized for Swift collection

üí° Calculate diffs for batch updates of list UI in `UIKit`, `AppKit` and [Texture](https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture)

üí° Supports both linear and sectioned collection even if contains duplicates

üí° Supports **all kind of diffs** for animated UI batch updates

---

## Algorithm

This is a diffing algorithm developed for [Carbon](https://github.com/ra1028/Carbon), works stand alone.  
The algorithm optimized based on the Paul Heckel's algorithm.  
See also his paper ["A technique for isolating differences between files"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359467) released in 1978.  
It allows all kind of diffs to be calculated in linear time **O(n)**.  
[RxDataSources](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources) and [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) are also implemented based on his algorithm.  

However, in `performBatchUpdates` of `UITableView`, `UICollectionView`, etc, there are combinations of diffs that cause crash when applied simultaneously.  
To solve this problem, `DifferenceKit` takes an approach of split the set of diffs at the minimal stages that can be perform batch updates with no crashes.

Implementation is [here](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/Sources/Algorithm.swift).

---

## Getting Started

- [API Documentation](https://ra1028.github.io/DifferenceKit)
- [Example Apps](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/Examples)
- [Benchmark](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/Benchmark)
- [Playground](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/DifferenceKit.playground/Contents.swift)

## Basic Usage

The type of the element that to take diffs must be conform to the `Differentiable` protocol.  
The `differenceIdentifier`'s type is generic associated type:
```swift
struct User: Differentiable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String

    var differenceIdentifier: Int {
        return id
    }

    func isContentEqual(to source: User) -> Bool {
        return name == source.name
    }
}
```

In the case of definition above, `id` uniquely identifies the element and get to know the user updated by comparing equality of `name` of the elements in source and target.

There are default implementations of `Differentiable` for the types that conforming to `Equatable` or `Hashable`Ôºö
```swift
// If `Self` conforming to `Hashable`.
var differenceIdentifier: Self {
    return self
}

// If `Self` conforming to `Equatable`.
func isContentEqual(to source: Self) -> Bool {
    return self == source
}
```
Therefore, you can simply:
```swift
extension String: Differentiable {}
```

Calculate the diffs by creating `StagedChangeset` from two collections of elements conforming to `Differentiable`:
```swift
let source = [
    User(id: 0, name: "Vincent"),
    User(id: 1, name: "Jules")
]
let target = [
    User(id: 1, name: "Jules"),
    User(id: 0, name: "Vincent"),
    User(id: 2, name: "Butch")
]

let changeset = StagedChangeset(source: source, target: target)
```

If you want to include multiple types conforming to `Differentiable` in the collection, use `AnyDifferentiable`:
```swift
let source = [
    AnyDifferentiable("A"),
    AnyDifferentiable(User(id: 0, name: "Vincent"))
]
```

In the case of sectioned collection, the section itself must have a unique identifier and be able to compare whether there is an update.  
So each section must conforming to `DifferentiableSection` protocol, but in most cases you can use `ArraySection` that general type conforming to it.  
`ArraySection` requires a model conforming to `Differentiable` for diffing from other sections:
```swift
enum Model: Differentiable {
    case a, b, c
}

let source: [ArraySection<Model, String>] = [
    ArraySection(model: .a, elements: ["A", "B"]),
    ArraySection(model: .b, elements: ["C"])
]
let target: [ArraySection<Model, String>] = [
    ArraySection(model: .c, elements: ["D", "E"]),
    ArraySection(model: .a, elements: ["A"]),
    ArraySection(model: .b, elements: ["B", "C"])
]

let changeset = StagedChangeset(source: source, target: target)
```

You can perform diffing batch updates of `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` using the created `StagedChangeset`.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't forget** to **synchronously** update the data referenced by the data-source, with the data passed in the `setData` closure. The diffs are applied in stages, and failing to do so is bound to create a crash:

```swift
tableView.reload(using: changeset, with: .fade) { data in
    dataSource.data = data
}
```

Batch updates using too large amount of diffs may adversely affect to performance.  
Returning `true` with `interrupt` closure then falls back to `reloadData`:
```swift
collectionView.reload(using: changeset, interrupt: { $0.changeCount > 100 }) { data in
    dataSource.data = data
}
```

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

Made a fair comparison as much as possible in performance and features with other **popular** and **awesome** frameworks.  
This does **NOT** determine superiority or inferiority of the frameworks.  
I know that each framework has different benefits.  
The frameworks and its version that compared is below.

### Performance Comparison

Benchmark project is [here](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit/blob/master/Benchmark).  
Performance was mesured by code compiled using `Xcode11.1` and `Swift 5.1` with `-O` optimization and run on `iPhone11 Pro simulator`.  
Use `Foundation.UUID` as an element of collections.
