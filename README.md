## Reporting an Issue

[Github Issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS/issues) are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more.
Please note we are still in very early stages development, so expect lots of bugs, etc. until we can reach a first alpha version.

## Setting up a development environment

In case you're interested in playing around with the code or giving something back, here are some instructions on how to set up your project:

1. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

  `sudo gem install cocoapods`

2. Install all the Pods

  `pod install`

3. Open `Rocket.Chat.xcworkspace`
4. Run the project (âŒ˜ + R)


### Code style guide

We're currently following the Swift Style Guide from Ray Wenderlich: https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide. The only exception is that we're using 4 spaces instead of 2.
